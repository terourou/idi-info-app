Note that some sentence types have no weight recorded (eg ‘Other’ sentence types including Final Protection Order and Order for forfeiture). Care should also be taken with the obsolete sentence type Community service (CS) which has no sentence weight (and so averages should not be calculated for Community work sentences prior to 2003 when this sentence type was replaced in the Sentencing Act 2002). 
Care should be taken for indeterminate prison sentences, which have no (or a value of ‘0’) sentence weight. These are life imprisonment (‘IML’ and ‘L’) and preventive detention ('PREV' and 'Z'). To estimate the weight of indeterminate sentences any minimum non-parole period imposed needs to be taken into account. However, this information is not currently included in the IDI dataset. Whilst not ideal, in its absence the minimum nonparole period can be estimated: 
 Life imprisonment = 10*365*1.5 (where 10 years is the minimum non-parole period * 365 days * a factor of 1.5)  Preventive detention = 5 years is the minimum non-parole period * 365 days * a factor of 1.5)."

A convicted charge may have more than one sentence imposed. As such, up to 5 sentences per charge are included in the dataset. These are ranked in order of seriousness, from moj_chg_serious_sentence1_code to moj_chg_serious_sentence5_code. 
Use the sentence metadata table to identify and categorise these. Any analysis of sentences needs to first limit the data to CONVICTED charges. This is because charge outcome types other than convicted can receive sentences and orders. For example, a person discharged without conviction, although not convicted, may be ordered to pay reparation, be disqualified from driving, or receive a Sentencing Act Final Protection Order. Failure to exclude non-convicted charges from sentence analysis will produce potentially misleadingly results with a large number of charges with ‘No sentence recorded’. 
The hierarchy used to rank sent1–sent5 is shown (broadly) by the alphabetical order of sent_10cat (the 10 categories included in the metadata sentence table). These are:  a. imprisonment b. home detention, (including ‘other custodial’ for pre 2004 data) c. community detention d. intensive supervision e. community work f. supervision g. monetary (within the monetary category, ‘reparation’ is ranked as more serious than ‘fine’) h. deferment i. other j. no sentence recorded. The sent_10cat is the preferred categorisation for sentence analysis. An alternative is to use sent_6cat where less differentiation of community or other sentence types is required. However, note that in sent_6cat imprisonment includes ‘other custodial’ pre-2004 sentences grouped together with Home detention in sent_10cat. 
1. Imprisonment (including ‘other custodial’ for pre-2004) 2. home detention 3. other community 4. monetary 5. other 6. no sentence recorded. There is also a youth specific categorisation – sent_youth. This orders penalties based on the section 283 Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989 hierarchy of responses:  s283(a)-(b) discharge, admonish  s283(c)-(j) monetary, confiscation, disqualification  s283(ja)-(jc) education, rehab programmes  s283(k)-(l) youth supervision, community work  s283(m) supervision with activity, intensive supervision  s283(n) supervision with residence  s283(o) adult sentences A combination of sent_youth and sent_10cat can be used, for example, to detail the types of adult sentence (eg imprisonment) received. Care should also be taken when applying the sentence categorisation to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th most serious sentences. The categorisation should not be applied to charges with no values for each of these variables eg  
case when sent2 = ' ' then ' '   else sentence_10cat end as sentence2 
 
Note the hierarchy of sentence types used by MOJ differs in two ways from the hierarchy of sentence types used by Corrections:   MOJ ranks community detention as more serious than intensive supervision.  MOJ ranks community work as more serious than supervision.  These differences mean analyses of most serious sentence using MOJ data may show higher counts of community work relative to supervision, and higher counts of community detention relative to intensive supervision, than parallel analysis using Corrections data. No legislative guidance advises which ranking is ‘correct’ (nor clear operational priority) and so this inconsistency between agencies is being allowed to continue rather than either agency needing to change. Changing either sentence hierarchy now would create inconsistency with previously published output dependent on the hierarchy of sentences."

Ethnicity is the ethnic group or groups a person identifies with or has a sense of belonging to. It is a measure of cultural affiliation (in contrast to race, ancestry, nationality, or citizenship). Ethnicity is self-perceived and a person can belong to more than one ethnic group. An ethnic group is made up of people who have some or all of the following characteristics: 
•	a common proper name 
•	one or more elements of common culture that need not be specified, but may include religion, customs, or language 
•	a unique community of interests, feelings, and actions 
•	a shared sense of common origins or ancestry 
•	a common geographic origin.
This definition is based on the work of A Smith (1986) “The Ethnic Origins of Nations”.

The ethnicities listed in this dataset come from the 2013 Census ethnicity variables (cen_ind_eth_rand6) level 1 ethnicity variables:

When determining regional boundaries, the Local Government Commission gave consideration to regional communities of interest when selecting water catchments to be included in a region. It also considered factors such as natural resource management, land use planning and environmental matters. Regional councils cover every territorial authority in New Zealand with the exception of Chatham Islands Territory. The seaward boundary of the regions is the twelve mile (19.3km) New Zealand territorial limit. Generally regional councils contain complete territorial authorities.

When defining the boundaries of territorial authorities, the Local Government Commission placed considerable weight on the 'community of interest'. While the size of a community was a factor, the relevance of the components of the community to each other and the capacity of the unit to service the community in an efficient manner, were the factors on which the Commission placed most emphasis. In general, the seaward boundary of a territorial authority is either the mean high water mark or mean low water springs. The interpretation of 'mean high water mark' includes the edge of man-made structures such as wharves and reclaimed land. A city must have a minimum population of 50,000, be predominantly urban in character, be a distinct entity and a major centre of activity within the region. A district serves a combination of rural and urban communities. The boundaries of wards and their parent territorial authorities may be reviewed in the year immediately preceding the three yearly local government elections. The review is conducted by the territorial authority under provisions contained in the Local Government Act. Territorial authorities are given a unique three digit code.

Offence categories are classified according to ANZSOC (2011 edition) divisions, subdivisions and groups.

About the Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC): The primary purpose of the ANZSOC is to provide a systematic ordering of criminal offences defined in the criminal laws of the Australian state and territory, and New Zealand jurisdictions. For the purposes of ANZSOC, an offence is defined as: any criminal act or omission by a person, persons, organisation or organisations for which a penalty could be imposed by the Australian or New Zealand legal system.

The definitions of categories have been specifically chosen to minimise any confusion as to the boundaries of each category. As a result the content of each category is uniform across jurisdictions, despite differences in legislation.

At the broadest level, the Classification makes distinctions based on the most fundamental elements of legal and behavioural criteria. These include:
-	whether the offence involved the use of violence;
-	whether the offence compromised the safety or well-being of persons or was solely directed at the acquisition or damage of property;
-	whether the offence involved an intentional act or resulted from recklessness or negligence; and
-	whether the offence had a specific victim, or constituted a breach of public order or other social codes.

Six criteria were used in the development of the Classification. These are listed below:
Violence: Whether violence is involved. If violence is involved the nature and level of the violence is considered including whether a weapon was used, whether abduction or deprivation of liberty was involved, whether the violence was sexual in nature and the outcome of the violence (e.g. whether life was taken, threatened or endangered).
Acquisition: Whether the intent of the offence is acquisitive (e.g. to obtain property). If so, the method of acquisition including theft, the use of extortion or blackmail or the use of deception, is considered.
Nature of Victim: The nature and vulnerability of the victim or object offended against. Types of victims include persons, property and the community.
Ancillary Offences: Whether the offence only exists as an extension of, or in relation to, another offence. Such offences include attempts, threats and conspiracies to commit another offence, or offences involving the intent that another offence shall take place.
Seriousness: Seriousness can be reflected through the involvement or otherwise of a personal victim, or it can be measured as a function of factors of aggravation, such as whether the victim was vulnerable; whether the offence was committed in company; or whether a weapon was used. It is important to note however that the divisions of the Classification are not ranked by seriousness. The Australian National Offence Index (NOI) is a separate statistical tool that enables selected ANZSOC groups to be ranked in order of seriousness.
Intent: Whether the offence occurs as a result of a negligent or reckless act, or as a result of an intent to commit an offence. This criterion distinguishes, for example, manslaughter from murder."
5406,"pol_clean","post_count_offenders","pol_poo_area_unit_code",1,1,1,1,0,"Recorded crime and investigations","NZ Police","Area unit location associated with the scene of an offence. Area units are the lowest level in the local government boundary spatial hierarchy. Unlike territorial authorities, they do not represent the boundary of an administrative region, but they either define, or aggregate to define, regional councils, territorial authorities, and urban areas.

Area units are aggregations of meshblocks. They are combined to make up territorial authorities. Area units are non-administrative areas intermediate between meshblocks and territorial authorities. Area units must either define or aggregate to define, regional councils, territorial authorities and urban areas. Area unit boundaries are defined at meshblock level.

Each area unit must be a single geographic entity with a unique name referring to a geographical feature.  Area units within urban areas are often a collection of city blocks or suburbs and normally contain 3,000-5,000 population though this can vary due to such things as industrial areas, port areas, rural areas and so on within the urban area boundaries.

In rural areas, area units may be equated to localities or communities. Due to the location of some territorial authorities over regional council boundaries, a number of area units have only two or three meshblocks and a very low population count.   

Area unit boundaries are revised once every five years in the year immediately before a Census of Population and Dwellings. There may also be changes in other years in conjunction with local government boundary changes.  Any changes will be incorporated into statistical outputs on 1 January the following year. Area units are given a unique six digit code.

Ethnicity is the ethnic group or groups a person identifies with or has a sense of belonging to. It is a measure of cultural affiliation (in contrast to race, ancestry, nationality, or citizenship). Ethnicity is self-perceived and a person can belong to more than one ethnic group. An ethnic group is made up of people who have some or all of the following characteristics: 
•	a common proper name 
•	one or more elements of common culture that need not be specified, but may include religion, customs, or language 
•	a unique community of interests, feelings, and actions 
•	a shared sense of common origins or ancestry 
•	a common geographic origin.
This definition is based on the work of A Smith (1986) “The Ethnic Origins of Nations”.

Note: Police record an alleged offender's ethnicity where it is known. The recorded ethnicity is the one that a person identifies with most strongly.
Recording an alleged offender's ethnicity may be difficult in some cases.
Measures of ethnicity can be influenced by the context in which they are collected. One of the reasons for this is that a degree of subjectivity is often involved. In a policing context this is particularly problematic, as alleged offenders may not be cooperative or coherent. Police ethnicity data is carried through to conviction and sentencing statistics.

Ethnicity classifications used within the Recorded Crime collections differ from classifications used in other government collections that use the 2005 ethnicity standard.

No allowance is made for people wanting to specify more than one ethnic group, which may distort or bias ethnic group statistics.

A meshblock is both a geographic unit and a classification. It is the smallest geographic unit for which statistical data is reported by Stats NZ. A meshblock is a defined geographic area, varying in size from part of a city block to large areas of rural land. Meshblocks are contiguous: each meshblock borders on another to form a network covering all of New Zealand, including coasts and inlets. The meshblock classification extends out to New Zealand’s 200 mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

Primary purposes of a meshblock classification are: 
•	to provide a small, relevant, and flexible building block geography for aggregation into statistical geographies such as sampling, collection, and output areas 
•	to ensure geographic boundaries can be physically identified and located on the ground by alignment with geographic or physical features, or with the cadastre (New Zealand’s land information and survey system for the accurate identification of boundaries for land tenure purposes)
•	to form the basis of the New Zealand electoral system as the lowest level building block, by which it defines electorates and polling areas for both parliamentary and local government elections.

Note: the Police derived this variable using the Census 2013 classification.

Meshblocks are derived from the geographic coordinates of the nearest reference location to the scene of an offence.
Negative values for meshblock identify offences where either:
•	location data for the offence is unknown or unrecorded
•	the offence is recorded by the Auckland Harbour Bridge Police Station (Auckland motorways area).
In these cases, the police station code is used to create a dummy meshblock number. To avoid the risk that a station code might coincide with a valid meshblock, the station code appears as a negative number.
Note: When an incident is processed by station ID 29 (Auckland Harbour Bridge, which covers the Auckland motorways area) the meshblock and area unit code are set to -000029 and -00029, respectively.

Ethnicity is the ethnic group or groups a person identifies with or has a sense of belonging to. It is a measure of cultural affiliation (in contrast to race, ancestry, nationality, or citizenship). Ethnicity is self-perceived and a person can belong to more than one ethnic group. An ethnic group is made up of people who have some or all of the following characteristics: 
•	a common proper name 
•	one or more elements of common culture that need not be specified, but may include religion, customs, or language 
•	a unique community of interests, feelings, and actions 
•	a shared sense of common origins or ancestry 
•	a common geographic origin.
This definition is based on the work of A Smith (1986) “The Ethnic Origins of Nations”.

Offence categories are classified according to ANZSOC (2011 edition) divisions, subdivisions and groups.

About the Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC): The primary purpose of the ANZSOC is to provide a systematic ordering of criminal offences defined in the criminal laws of the Australian state and territory, and New Zealand jurisdictions. For the purposes of ANZSOC, an offence is defined as: any criminal act or omission by a person, persons, organisation or organisations for which a penalty could be imposed by the Australian or New Zealand legal system.

The definitions of categories have been specifically chosen to minimise any confusion as to the boundaries of each category. As a result the content of each category is uniform across jurisdictions, despite differences in legislation.

At the broadest level, the Classification makes distinctions based on the most fundamental elements of legal and behavioural criteria. These include:
-	whether the offence involved the use of violence;
-	whether the offence compromised the safety or well-being of persons or was solely directed at the acquisition or damage of property;
-	whether the offence involved an intentional act or resulted from recklessness or negligence; and
-	whether the offence had a specific victim, or constituted a breach of public order or other social codes.

Six criteria were used in the development of the Classification. These are listed below:
Violence: Whether violence is involved. If violence is involved the nature and level of the violence is considered including whether a weapon was used, whether abduction or deprivation of liberty was involved, whether the violence was sexual in nature and the outcome of the violence (e.g. whether life was taken, threatened or endangered).
Acquisition: Whether the intent of the offence is acquisitive (e.g. to obtain property). If so, the method of acquisition including theft, the use of extortion or blackmail or the use of deception, is considered.
Nature of Victim: The nature and vulnerability of the victim or object offended against. Types of victims include persons, property and the community.
Ancillary Offences: Whether the offence only exists as an extension of, or in relation to, another offence. Such offences include attempts, threats and conspiracies to commit another offence, or offences involving the intent that another offence shall take place.
Seriousness: Seriousness can be reflected through the involvement or otherwise of a personal victim, or it can be measured as a function of factors of aggravation, such as whether the victim was vulnerable; whether the offence was committed in company; or whether a weapon was used. It is important to note however that the divisions of the Classification are not ranked by seriousness. The Australian National Offence Index (NOI) is a separate statistical tool that enables selected ANZSOC groups to be ranked in order of seriousness.
Intent: Whether the offence occurs as a result of a negligent or reckless act, or as a result of an intent to commit an offence. This criterion distinguishes, for example, manslaughter from murder."

Area units are the lowest level in the local government boundary spatial hierarchy. Unlike territorial authorities, they do not represent the boundary of an administrative region, but they either define, or aggregate to define, regional councils, territorial authorities, and urban areas.

Area units are aggregations of meshblocks. They are combined to make up territorial authorities. Area units are non-administrative areas intermediate between meshblocks and territorial authorities. Area units must either define or aggregate to define, regional councils, territorial authorities and urban areas. Area unit boundaries are defined at meshblock level.

Each area unit must be a single geographic entity with a unique name referring to a geographical feature.  Area units within urban areas are often a collection of city blocks or suburbs and normally contain 3,000-5,000 population though this can vary due to such things as industrial areas, port areas, rural areas and so on within the urban area boundaries.

In rural areas, area units may be equated to localities or communities. Due to the location of some territorial authorities over regional council boundaries, a number of area units have only two or three meshblocks and a very low population count.   

Area unit boundaries are revised once every five years in the year immediately before a Census of Population and Dwellings. There may also be changes in other years in conjunction with local government boundary changes.  Any changes will be incorporated into statistical outputs on 1 January the following year. Area units are given a unique six digit code.

Ethnicity is the ethnic group or groups a person identifies with or has a sense of belonging to. It is a measure of cultural affiliation (in contrast to race, ancestry, nationality, or citizenship). Ethnicity is self-perceived and a person can belong to more than one ethnic group. An ethnic group is made up of people who have some or all of the following characteristics: 
•	a common proper name 
•	one or more elements of common culture that need not be specified, but may include religion, customs, or language 
•	a unique community of interests, feelings, and actions 
•	a shared sense of common origins or ancestry 
•	a common geographic origin.
This definition is based on the work of A Smith (1986) “The Ethnic Origins of Nations”.

Note: Police record an alleged offender's ethnicity where it is known. The recorded ethnicity is the one that a person identifies with most strongly.
Recording an alleged offender's ethnicity may be difficult in some cases.
Measures of ethnicity can be influenced by the context in which they are collected. One of the reasons for this is that a degree of subjectivity is often involved. In a policing context this is particularly problematic, as alleged offenders may not be cooperative or coherent. Police ethnicity data is carried through to conviction and sentencing statistics.

Ethnicity classifications used within the Recorded Crime collections differ from classifications used in other government collections that use the 2005 ethnicity standard.

No allowance is made for people wanting to specify more than one ethnic group, which may distort or bias ethnic group statistics.

Use caution when attempting to combine data from different sources to form estimates of offending rates (per head of population) for specific ethnic groups.

A meshblock is both a geographic unit and a classification. It is the smallest geographic unit for which statistical data is reported by Stats NZ. A meshblock is a defined geographic area, varying in size from part of a city block to large areas of rural land. Meshblocks are contiguous: each meshblock borders on another to form a network covering all of New Zealand, including coasts and inlets. The meshblock classification extends out to New Zealand’s 200 mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

Primary purposes of a meshblock classification are: 
•	to provide a small, relevant, and flexible building block geography for aggregation into statistical geographies such as sampling, collection, and output areas 
•	to ensure geographic boundaries can be physically identified and located on the ground by alignment with geographic or physical features, or with the cadastre (New Zealand’s land information and survey system for the accurate identification of boundaries for land tenure purposes)
•	to form the basis of the New Zealand electoral system as the lowest level building block, by which it defines electorates and polling areas for both parliamentary and local government elections.

Note: the Police derived this variable using the Census 2013 classification.

Meshblocks are derived from the geographic coordinates of the nearest reference location to the scene of an offence.
Negative values for meshblock identify offences where either:
•	location data for the offence is unknown or unrecorded
•	the offence is recorded by the Auckland Harbour Bridge Police Station (Auckland motorways area).
In these cases, the police station code is used to create a dummy meshblock number. To avoid the risk that a station code might coincide with a valid meshblock, the station code appears as a negative number.
Note: When an incident is processed by station ID 29 (Auckland Harbour Bridge, which covers the Auckland motorways area) the meshblock and area unit code are set to -000029 and -00029, respectively. Reference locations on the Auckland motorway network frequently span two or more meshblocks because the motorway centreline is often a convenient meshblock boundary."

Ethnicity is the ethnic group or groups a person identifies with or has a sense of belonging to. It is a measure of cultural affiliation (in contrast to race, ancestry, nationality, or citizenship). Ethnicity is self-perceived and a person can belong to more than one ethnic group. An ethnic group is made up of people who have some or all of the following characteristics: 
•	a common proper name 
•	one or more elements of common culture that need not be specified, but may include religion, customs, or language 
•	a unique community of interests, feelings, and actions 
•	a shared sense of common origins or ancestry 
•	a common geographic origin.
This definition is based on the work of A Smith (1986) “The Ethnic Origins of Nations”.

Police record a victim's ethnicity where it is known. Recording a victim's ethnicity may be inappropriate in some cases. The recorded ethnicity is the one that a person identifies with most strongly. 
Ethnicity classifications used within the Recorded Crime collections differ from classifications used in other government collections that use the 2005 ethnicity standard. No allowance is made for people wanting to specify more than one ethnic group, which may distort or bias ethnic group statistics.

Negative values for meshblock identify offences where either: 
•	location data for the offence is unknown or unrecorded  
•	the offence is recorded by the Auckland Harbour Bridge Police Station (Auckland motorways area). 
In these cases, the police station code is used to create a dummy meshblock number. To avoid the risk that a station code might coincide with a valid meshblock, the station code appears as a negative number. 
Note: When an incident is processed by station ID 29 (Auckland Harbour Bridge, which covers the Auckland motorways area) the meshblock and area unit code are set to  -000029 and -00029, respectively.
